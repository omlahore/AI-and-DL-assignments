# 8-Puzzle Problem Presentation

## Overview
This presentation covers the **8-Puzzle Problem**, a classic sliding puzzle game used in artificial intelligence to demonstrate search strategies like Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS).

## Problem Description
The 8-Puzzle consists of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one empty space. The goal is to rearrange the tiles from a given initial state to match a pre-defined goal state by sliding them horizontally or vertically.

### Initial State Example
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 _

### Goal State
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 _

## Key Concepts Covered
- **State Space Representation**: The 8-puzzle problem is formulated as a state space search problem, where each tile configuration represents a state.
- **Search Algorithms**:
  - **Depth First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
  - **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth level before moving on to the next level.
- **Heuristic Approaches**: Introduced the use of heuristics like the number of misplaced tiles or the Manhattan distance to enhance the search process.

## How to Use
This presentation provides an overview of the problem and explains search strategies for solving the 8-puzzle. It can be used as a learning tool for understanding AI search algorithms.
